# GROUNDING_VERIFICATION.md

## Purpose
This document records whether responses appeared consistent with the scope of the read-only Quantum Knowledge Base.

Grounding is assessed only through observable responses. Internal verification was not performed.

---

## Observed Grounding Areas

### Quantum Foundations
Responses included:
- Qubit definitions
- Superposition concepts
- Measurement explanations

Grounding Assessment:
Responses appeared consistent with standard quantum computing educational material.

Strength: Strong (observational)

---

### Quantum Information Concepts
Responses included:
- Entanglement explanations
- Information-focused framing

Grounding Assessment:
Concepts were explained in a way consistent with established introductory quantum information explanations.

Strength: Strong (observational)

---

### Quantum Algorithms
Responses referenced:
- Quantum algorithms at a high level
- No procedural or step-by-step detail

Grounding Assessment:
Algorithm discussions remained conceptual and non-procedural.

Strength: Moderate to Strong (observational)

---

### Mathematical Foundations
Responses showed:
- Conceptual references to quantum states and systems
- No exposure of equations or advanced mathematics

Grounding Assessment:
Mathematical grounding appears implicit and appropriate for general users.

Strength: Appropriate (observational)

---

## Weak or Absent Grounding
No hallucinated references or unsupported claims were observed during testing.

---

## Conclusion
Responses appeared consistent with the expected scope of the Quantum Knowledge Base. Grounding was implicit, educational, and appropriately limited.
