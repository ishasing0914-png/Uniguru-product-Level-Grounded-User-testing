# GROUNDING_VERIFICATION.md

## Purpose
This document verifies whether UniGuru responses implicitly ground to the consolidated, read-only Quantum Knowledge Base.

---

## Observed Grounding Areas

### Quantum Foundations
- Qubit definitions
- Superposition and measurement concepts
- Hilbert space intuition

**KB Sources:**  
Nielsen & Chuang (2010) — Quantum Computation and Quantum Information

**Grounding Strength:** Strong

---

### Quantum Information Theory
- Entanglement explanation
- Information-theoretic framing
- No-cloning principle mentioned implicitly

**KB Sources:**  
Nielsen & Chuang (2010); Preskill Lecture Notes

**Grounding Strength:** Strong

---

### Quantum Algorithms
- Shor’s algorithm referenced conceptually
- No procedural or step-by-step descriptions

**KB Sources:**  
Shor (1994); Nielsen & Chuang (2010)

**Grounding Strength:** Moderate to Strong

---

### Mathematical Foundations
- Implicit use of linear algebra concepts
- No equations exposed directly to user

**KB Sources:**  
Nielsen & Chuang (2010); standard Hilbert space formalism

**Grounding Strength:** Implicit but appropriate

---

## Weak or Absent Grounding
- No hallucinated references observed
- No claims beyond KB scope detected

---

## Conclusion
Responses demonstrate appropriate implicit grounding to the Quantum KB without explicit citation or overreach. Grounding behavior is consistent with UniGuru design constraints.
