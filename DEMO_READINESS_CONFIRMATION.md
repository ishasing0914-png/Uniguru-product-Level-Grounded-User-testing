# DEMO_READINESS_CONFIRMATION.md

## Demo-Safe Capabilities
- Conceptual explanations of quantum computing
- Foundational definitions (qubits, entanglement, measurement)
- High-level algorithm overviews (Shor, Grover)
- Calm responses to emotional or ambiguous questions

---

## What to Avoid in Demo
- Requests for step-by-step algorithms
- Performance or timeline predictions
- Claims of real-world execution or authority
- Debug or signal-level visibility

---

## Edge Cases to Steer Away From
- Cryptography panic framing
- Medical, legal, or financial advice scenarios
- Requests implying system agency or decision-making power

---

## Overall Assessment
UniGuru is safe to demonstrate as an explanatory, grounded, non-authoritative AI system. Demo should focus on understanding and education, not capability claims.
